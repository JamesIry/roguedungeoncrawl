Playing with Rust by building a simple roguelike. Originally based on [Hands-on Rust: Effective Learning through 2D Game Development and Play](https://hands-on-rust.com/) by Herbert Wolverson, though with a few changes. Don't expect great code with insightful comments nor a terrific game play experiences. This is just a playground.
